				<p class="body-text modal-text-body">To conclude my Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Waterloo, my design project group and I decided to create a robot capable of autonomously painting lines on surfaces ranging from grass to snow to concrete. The robot prototype is in its final stages now. Lines may be programmed into the robot for parking lots, airports, highways, and more.</p>
				
				<p class="body-text modal-text-body">I was responsible for the electrical infrastructure and doing the programming. I soldered together a protoboard shield that could pressure fit into the headers on the Arduino Uno. This protoboard allowed for relay control of the pump and solenoid. I wrote the motor logic in JavaScript and used C++ ROS (Robot Operating System) nodes for intercommunication.</p>				</div>
