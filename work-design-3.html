				<p class="body-text modal-text-body">I've always enjoyed creating games, and I feel that designing the splash screen is critical in setting a proper tone. I have published games on Facebook, Mindjolt, and the iTunes App Store, and designed the splash screens and game graphics for each. What I most enjoy about splash screen design is that it is a separate entity from the game itself, unrestricted by technical and engineering limitations; this makes for a very liberating design process.
