				<p class="body-text modal-text-body">I was involved with a group of Mechanical Engineering students designing an orientation-independent magnetic outlet adapter. This adapter would plug into a standard outlet and allow for rapid connection/disconnection. The cord could then rotate 360 degrees while remaining attached and providing power, rendering this useful for cable management.</p>
			
			<p class="body-text modal-text-body">The circuit design consisted of concentric aluminum rings, with the ground ring set into the adapter making the adapter tamper-proof. The other two rings were for the hot and neutral wire. Thick wiring was used alongside highly conductive internal components, so that this product could be used on high voltage household circuits if desired.</p>				</div>
