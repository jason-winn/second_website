				<p class="body-text modal-text-body">In high school I was the lead layout editor for the school's newspaper, which placed second in the Toronto Star's layout competition. This volunteer position gave me a lot of experience with wrangling and arranging mixed-media content to fit well into a finite space; I often feel this gave me a leg up when it came time to design for mobile devices and their limited screen real-estate.</p>
