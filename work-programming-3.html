					<p class="title-text modal-text-title">A New Kind of Beacon At the Airport</p>
				<p class="body-text modal-text-body">IBM was interested in applying iBeacons to meet their airline partners’ needs. This project was my own from the outset to completion. The premise is that a customer service rep in the airport has an iPad that allows them to view where each passenger with the Air Canada iPhone or Android mobile app is located in the airport, allowing them to push special offers, send push notifications to page passengers, and more.</p>
				
				<p class="body-text modal-text-body">With iBeacons placed at strategic locations in the airport, the detected beacon identifier is cross-referenced with the airline’s database of flights and gates. This then registers that the passenger has arrived at the particular location. The portal was built using AngularJS with WebSockets to allow for instantaneous updates.</p>
