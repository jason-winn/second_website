				<p class="body-text modal-text-body">I love to fly. It’s the classic ‘ever since I was a young boy’ type of story. I fly from Buttonville Airport in Toronto. I have had my license since 2012, and enjoy taking friends and family up on the weekend for sightseeing or to go to a small Ontario town away from the city. Though I fly VFR, I’m proficient with common IFR patterns, as well as the ATC (Air Traffic Control) methodologies in Toronto's airspace.</p>			</div>
